## Accessibility

The VERT Stack Template is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users. We've implemented several features to ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance and to create an inclusive user experience.

### Implemented Features

1. **Color Contrast**: Ensured that all text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast ratios.

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:

   - Implemented a skip link for keyboard users to bypass repetitive content.
   - Enhanced focus styles for all interactive elements.
   - Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**:

   - Added ARIA labels to improve context for screen reader users.
   - Implemented proper heading structure for better content navigation.
   - Used semantic HTML elements to provide clear document structure.

4. **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the layout remains accessible on different screen sizes and orientations.

5. **Text Spacing**: Improved text spacing for better readability, adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

6. **Page Titles**: Implemented dynamic page titles for each route to provide context for users.

7. **Language Declaration**: Set the language of the page programmatically to assist screen readers.

8. **Error Handling**: Implemented an accessible error boundary to provide clear error messages to all users.

9. **Dynamic Content Updates**: Added ARIA live regions for dynamically updating content to keep screen reader users informed of changes.

10. **High Contrast Mode**: Included styles to support high contrast mode for users who require it.

### Next Steps

While we've implemented a strong foundation for accessibility, there are always areas for improvement:

1. **Automated Testing**: Integrate automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe-core, jest-axe) into the CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Manual Testing**: Conduct regular manual testing with various assistive technologies across different browsers and devices.

3. **User Testing**: Engage with users who rely on assistive technologies to gather feedback on the application's accessibility.

4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation on accessibility features and known limitations.

5. **Form Accessibility**: As forms are added to the application, ensure they are fully accessible, including proper labeling and error handling.

6. **Multimedia Content**: If audio or video content is added, ensure proper captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions are provided.

7. **Ongoing Education**: Keep the development team updated on the latest accessibility best practices and WCAG guidelines.

8. **Accessibility Statement**: Develop and maintain an accessibility statement for the application.

9. **Third-party Component Audit**: Regularly audit any third-party components or libraries for accessibility compliance.

10. **Performance Optimization**: Continue to optimize performance, as this can significantly impact the experience for users of assistive technologies.

By following these next steps, we can ensure that the VERT Stack Template remains at the forefront of web accessibility standards.

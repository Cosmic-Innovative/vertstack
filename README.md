# VERT Stack Template

- **V**ite for fast development and building
- **E**SLint for code quality and consistency
- **R**eact for building user interfaces
- **T**ypeScript for type safety

## Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Vite for lightning fast development and building
- üèó TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience
- ‚öõÔ∏è React 18 for building interactive UIs
- üìè ESLint for code linting with modern configuration (eslint.config.js)
- üíñ Prettier for code formatting
- üê∂ Husky for Git hooks
- üö´ lint-staged for running linters on Git staged files
- üß™ Vitest for fast and efficient testing
- üõ°Ô∏è Error Boundaries for graceful error handling in production
- üîÑ Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev`: Start the development server
- `pnpm build`: Build the project for production
- `pnpm preview`: Preview the production build
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint
- `pnpm lint:fix`: Run ESLint and automatically fix issues
- `pnpm format`: Run Prettier to format all files
- `pnpm prepare`: Install Husky git hooks (runs automatically after install)
- `pnpm test`: Run Vitest tests
- `pnpm test:watch`: Run Vitest in watch mode
- `pnpm test:coverage`: Run Vitest with coverage report

## Testing

This project uses Vitest for testing. Vitest is a Vite-native testing framework that's fast and efficient. It's compatible with Jest's API, making it easy to migrate existing tests.

To run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. The configuration is set up in `eslint.config.js` and `.prettierrc.json` respectively.

To run the linter:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

To format code with Prettier:

```bash
pnpm format
```

## Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to manage Git hooks. The pre-commit hook runs lint-staged, which in turn runs ESLint and Prettier on staged files.

## CI/CD

This project includes a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline runs on each push and pull request to the main branch, performing the following steps:

1. **Install dependencies**
2. **Run linter**
3. **Run tests**
4. **Build the project**

You can find the workflow configuration in .github/workflows/main.yml.

## Future Roadmap

While the VERT Stack Template provides a robust foundation for many projects, here are some additional features we're working on implementing. Feel free to submit a pull request. :)

1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment-specific configurations for development, staging, and production.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Set up code splitting and lazy loading for improved performance.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Add security-focused linting rules and implement other security best practices.
4. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Add support for multiple languages if required for your application.
5. **PWA Support**: Implement service workers and add a web app manifest for progressive web app capabilities.
6. **Comprehensive Example**: Develop a more detailed example showcasing routing, state management, and API calls.
7. **Expanded Documentation**: Provide more comprehensive documentation on project structure, design decisions, and best practices.
8. **Accessibility Implementation**: Implement accessibility checks in ESLint and ensure the template follows accessibility best practices.

These items are not necessarily required for all projects but represent areas where the template could be extended to meet more specific or advanced needs.

## How to Proceed from Here

### Adding a UI Component Library

To enhance your development process and ensure UI consistency, you might want to add a UI component library. Here are some popular options:

1. **Ant Design (Recommended)**

   Ant Design is a comprehensive UI library with a wide range of components and built-in support for animations via Ant Motion.

   To add Ant Design to your project:

   ```bash
   pnpm add antd @ant-design/icons
   ```

   To use Ant Motion for animations:

   ```bash
   pnpm add rc-tween-one @ant-design/react-slick
   ```

   [Ant Design Documentation](https://ant.design/)
   [Ant Motion Documentation](https://motion.ant.design/)

2. **Material-UI (MUI)**

   A popular React UI framework implementing Google's Material Design.

   ```bash
   pnpm add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
   ```

   [MUI Documentation](https://mui.com/)

3. **Chakra UI**

   A simple, modular, and accessible component library for React applications.

   ```bash
   pnpm add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
   ```

   [Chakra UI Documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/)

After adding your chosen UI library, you may need to set up theme providers or import styles. Refer to the respective documentation for detailed setup instructions.

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Routing**: Consider adding React Router for navigation in multi-page applications.

2. **Enhance Accessibility**: Integrate eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y into your ESLint configuration for accessibility checks.

3. **SEO Optimization**: Add React Helmet for basic SEO setup.

4. **Authentication**: Implement a basic authentication system based on your backend requirements.
